# Predicting-and-Analyzing-the-Hospital-Readmission-Using-MIMIC-3-Dataset     
•	The main objective of the project is to extract all the features from the MIMIC dataset that are required to predict Readmission status of the patient.     
•	Analyzing the dataset to identify the top features that are causing the patient to readmit. Understanding the classification matrix generated from the models.   
•	Comparing AUC of various models and check for overfitting of the data.     
•	Performing Calibration on the Train and Test set using Isotonic and Sigmoid functions.       
•	Perform Sensitivity Analysis
